            padding:10px;

    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <p> The h1 tage= uses the entire screen, so when you create a borderline, takes up the entire screen.
        <br><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>
        <br> However, for a tag, only takes up the specific portion, only the word part. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Although, you can change the h1 part into taking up only a block part by putting another property,
        <br>display: incline;
        <br>Also, if want to get rid of all the display effects, just set to none like this : 
        <br><b>display:none;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The code I commented out contains quite similar stuff, so instead of writing each tags, 
        <br> Used comma to add the tag selectors. 
        <br> Also, instead of writing all the border tags, it is better to write them in all one sentences.
        <br>Like this => " <b>border:5px solid red;</b> "  
    </p>

    <h3>Padding</h3>
    If want to give a space between the content and the borderline, use padding as a tag and assign pixel values. 
    Also, can assign bunch of attributes such as ; margin and width so control the design of each boxes. 
    <!-- 
        Originally the style code looked like this : 
        h1{
            border-width:5px;
            border-color:red;
            border-style:solid;
            display:incline;
        } 

        a{
            border-width:5px;
            border-color:red;
            border-style:solid;
            display:block;
        } 
    -->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        So when some text takes up all the spaces in the screen, called <b>block level element </b>
        <br> and when only takes space for that specific text, called <b>inline element. </b>
        <br>Also, when controlling the size, use ' <b>width</b> ' and ' <b>height</b> '. 
        <br> <b>Padding</b> is for the space between the contents and borderline 
        <br> <b>Margin</b> is the space between each borderline when there is more than one boxes.
