    <h2>Use of Selectors</h2>
    <p>What we want to do, is 
        <ul>
            <li>Turn every text into colour black</li>
            <li>Turn the font of visited link to grey</li>
            To do this, first group the certain texts you want to change the color of 
            <br> by giving them the attribute ' class="(whatever u want to write)" '.
            <br> Next, in the style part at the above, create a class by writing '.saw'
            <br> '.saw' becomes a selector of every text that has saw as its selector. 
            
            <li>Turn the colour of the current text of the page into red</li>
            For this one, we added active part in the tag of the current page, and added a new class of active in the style part. 
            However, it only works as you put the ' .active ' part below the ' .saw ' part. 
            <br> Would not work of you changed the order. 
            <br> So need to use a selector that has a higher priority. which is <strong>id</strong> selector.
            <br> and use #active instead of .active in the style class above.
            <br> And, can use the name of id one.  <b>Cannot be repeated</b>. One and only value

            <br> However, if they share the same selector, for example class, the last one has the highest priority. 
            <br> but overall, the selectors w highest priority is : id selector(' #active '), class selector(' .saw '), and tag selector(' .a '). 
        </ul>

        <br> Can look up bunch of selectors by looking up 'CSS selectors.'
