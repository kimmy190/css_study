        #grid{
            border:5px solid pink;
            display:grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
        }

<body>
    <div id="grid">
        <div>NAVIGATION</div>
        <div>ARTICLE</div>
    </div>
    
    <p> 
        If want to surround the existing div part, can create a div class to do that like above. 
        <br> ' 1fr ' is the tag that uses to take all the remaining spaces. If you use both ' 1fr ' together, 
        <br> both columns will have the same size, adjusting it to the screen. 

        <br> Also, the size of the grid automatically adjusts depending on the size of the text. 

    </p>
    <!-- 
        Div tag is used for no purposes. It does not contain any meaning and only used for 
        design puposes. 
        Also, they use the entire screen, block level element so changng the lines are available. 
        Other similar tag would be span, but that is an inline element so , no change in the lines.
