    <h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0AlL9YI6bM" type="_blank">Basic grammar of CSS</a></h1>
    <p>
        First of all, to seperate the section of html and css, we use the tag 'style' , 
        <br> however, there is an another method.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="one.html" style="color:red">one</a></li>
        <li><a href="two.html">two </a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For example, we are going to use css to express that we are on the page we want to.
        <br> going to put color:red in the style, and style is an attribute of HTML. 
        <br>However, the a {} part in the style tag is referred to as <strong>selector.</strong>
        <br> It means that its selecting all of the a tag, which is the reason why its called as selector. 
        <br>Also, the color:black part inside the a{} is called <strong>declaration</strong>. 
        <br>Keep in mind that we dont have to use a selector when we are using the style tag inside the line of code instead of only 
        using the style tage. We just need a declaration. 
    </p>

        <h2>Summary of using CSS inside HTML</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the style tag</li>
            <li>Use the style as an attribute</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Use <strong>text-decoration: -- ;</strong> in order to get rid of the lines in the text, so to do that, 
        <br> set text-decoration  to none.
